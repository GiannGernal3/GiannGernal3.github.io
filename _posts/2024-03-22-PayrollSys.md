# MotorPH Payroll System Documentation
#### Prerequisites: JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

## Introduction

This document will discuss the payroll system that is created for employees of Motor PH to view or manage their data or salary within the company. It is also where the HR manager or IT department will input or manage the employee data being stored in this system. This application is created for employees who have trouble accessing their info when they work for Motor PH so that’s why this interface is created not just to store their data but also to request leave or overtime when they work for the company. 

### User Roles

The users who will use this application will be the employees who can view their data and the HR manager and IT who are in charge of managing and editing the employee data inputted in the payroll system. The employee can also send a request for leave or overtime within the app and the HR manager is in charge if they choose to accept or reject any of the requests received by their employees.

### Navigating the User Guide

This is how the user can navigate through the system/application for MotorPH:

* Employees need to sign in with a designated username and password to confirm they work in Motor PH whether they are an employee or HR manager. 
*  The user/employee has access to the self-service portal to access the attendance history, employee data, requests for leave, and other information within the system
* HR manager and IT department can manage and edit the employee data or calculations to be stored in the payroll system.

## Getting Started 
This section covers the prerequisites for using the payroll system. It includes hardware, software, and access guides essential for MotorPH employees and other stakeholders to ensure a smooth process. The hardware prerequisites will outline the necessary specifications for seamless system operation. Similarly, the software requirement specifications will ensure compatibility. Lastly, the access guides will orient users to the payroll system and its functionalities.

### Hardware Prerequisites
The payroll system will require hardware specifications to ensure smooth functionality, where the hardware can handle the necessary load the payroll system will put on it. This Hardware specification will be required from the stakeholders to ensure a smooth operation.

* Minimum Requirements: 

    * Processor: Dual-Core / Four-Threads CPU clocked @ 2.0ghz 64-bit (Preferably released no later than 2012)
    * RAM: 8gb DDR3 1800mhz/ DDR4 2400mhz
    * Storage: 256gb SSD 
    * Graphics: Integrated Graphics

* Recommended Requirements: 

    * Processor: Quad-Core CPU clocked at 3.0ghz 64-bit (Preferably released no later than 2012)
    * RAM: 16gb DDR3 1800mhz/ DDR4 2400mhz
    * Storage: 256gb SSD
    * Graphics: Integrated Graphics

### Software Prerequisites
The payroll system will require software specifications to ensure smooth functionality, where the software is compatible with the programming language used by the payroll system. This Software specification will be required from the stakeholders to ensure a smooth operation.

* Windows: Any Windows x64 version (Win 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 x64)
* MacOS: Any MacOS or MacOSX version that supports Java
* Linux: Any Linux distro that supports Java

The Payroll System is dependent on Java, a crucial programming language, for its operation. Developed entirely in Java, without it, any operating system would be unable to execute the program. Thus, having a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed is an essential prerequisite for running the Payroll System.

### Accessing the System
A documentation website will be provided to MotorPH and its stakeholders, On this website, all necessary instructions, prerequisites, and instructions will be documented for the intended users to understand the functionalities of the system properly. On this website, a link is also provided, this link will serve as the download link for the payroll system.
